## 🌟 Unique Selling Propositions (USP)

Nebula AI Copilot is the first **"Privacy-Preserving Life OS"** on Cardano, distinguishing itself from standard dApps through:

1.  **Zero-Knowledge Wellness 🧘‍♂️**: Utilizes **Midnight Network's ZK proofs** to allow users to verify healthy habits (for rewards/insurance) without ever revealing private journal entries or medical data.
2.  **AI-Driven DeFi 🧠**: Goes beyond passive wallet viewing by employing an active **Finance Agent** that analyzes spending patterns and portfolio health to provide personalized, actionable financial advice.
3.  **Holistic "Health & Wealth" Integration 🔄**: Recognizes the intrinsic link between physical well-being and financial stability, offering a unified dashboard that tracks and optimizes both simultaneously.
4.  **The Dopamine Agent 🎭**: Features a "Privacy-Preserving Meme Therapy" agent that autonomously scrapes trending content from Reddit (e.g., r/wholesomememes) based on your ZK-proofed mood, delivering instant emotional relief without revealing your state to a centralized server.
